#TODO:
    #To call the Gaussian Quadrature function enter the following parameters:
    #function, starting poing, ending point and tolerance.
    #The points are the limits of the integral and the tolerance will decide when to stop calculating
    #The function is defined as lambda funtion (view f below).
